## Section 1 – DataSyncManager::retry_connection()
- **Plain English**: This function tries to reconnect to the database if the initial attempt fails. It waits for a specific amount of time before trying again, increasing the wait time after each failure (backoff).
- **Pattern**: Recursive approach with a hardcoded sleep timer.
- **Issues**: Blocking the main thread during sleep; no maximum cap on wait times.
- **Improvements**: Implement asynchronous sleep and a maximum backoff limit to prevent infinite loops.

## Section 2 – AuthService::generate_token()
- **Plain English**: Creates a secure digital 'pass' (JWT) for the user. It packs user ID and roles into a signed message that expires after a set time.
- **Pattern**: Manual dictionary construction and signing using an external library.
- **Issues**: Secret key is sourced from an insecure local config; expiration is set too long (24h).
- **Improvements**: Use environment variables for keys and implement refresh tokens for shorter access token lifespans.

## Section 3 – QueryBuilder::parse_filters()
- **Plain English**: Takes a list of search criteria from the user and turns them into a format the database understands.
- **Pattern**: Nested loops with multiple string concatenations.
- **Issues**: High risk of SQL injection due to lack of parameterization; hard to read/maintain.
- **Improvements**: Use a dedicated ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool or parameterized query builders to secure the data.

## Section 4 – CacheService::evict_stale_data()
- **Plain English**: Automatically finds and deletes saved data that hasn't been used in a long time to free up memory.
- **Pattern**: Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm implemented with a linked list.
- **Issues**: The cleanup process is triggered on every read, which can slow down performance during peak traffic.
- **Improvements**: Run the eviction process as a background task at specific intervals instead of on every request.
